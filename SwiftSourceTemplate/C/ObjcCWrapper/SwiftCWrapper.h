// Although not necessary, an objc wrapper over all the c code can make thinking about it easier to turn this into a pure C module later since we're following the same convention on cpp and objc land. You can totally import the C headers directly into the ObjC bridging header without wrapping it in an ObjC class since ObjC is a superset of C.
